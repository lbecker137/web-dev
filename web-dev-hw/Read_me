# My Intro-Web-Dev Homework Repo
## Leah Becker

I have decided to take this class to develop my practical coding skills.
As many people my age do, I spend much of my time on the internet. Learning the
skills associated with webdesign will give me better knowledge of where I spend my
time as well as allow me to interact in a deeper fashion.

Some interesting things I found about the internet in this section was
+ while I pictured the internet as being 'the web', that term refers to a separate entity
+ I have never thought about how the internet is world wide. Actual, physical cables connect us to one annother
+ Most of the pages on the internet are 'dark web', or not easily accessed by users.

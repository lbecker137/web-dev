      <pre>
        It started with a low light
        Next thing I knew they ripped me from my bed
        And then they took my blood type
        It left a strange impression in my head

        You know that I was hoping
        That I could leave this star-crossed world behind
        But when they cut me open,
        I guess that changed my mind

        And you know I might
        Have just flown too far from the floor this time
        'Cause they calling me by my name
        And the zipping white light beams
        Disregards the bombs and satellites
        That was the turning point
        That was one lonely night

        The star maker says, it ain't so bad
        The dream maker's going make you mad
        The spaceman says, everybody look down
        It's all in your mind

        Well now I'm back at home, and
        I'm looking forward to this life I live
        You know its gonna haunt me
        So hesitation to this life I give

        You think you might cross over
        You're caught between the devil and the deep blue sea
        You better look it over
        Before you make that leap

        And you know I'm fine
        But I hear those voices at night sometimes
        They justify my claim
        And the public don't dwell my transmission
        Cause it wasn't televised
        But, it was the turning point
        Oh what a lonely night

        The star maker says, it ain't so bad
        The dream maker's going make you mad
        The spaceman says, everybody look down
        It's all in your mind

        The star maker says, it ain't so bad
        The dream maker's going make you mad
        The spaceman says, everybody look down
        It's all in your mind

        My global position systems are vocally addressed
        They say the Nile used to run from east to west
        They say the Nile used to run, from east to west

        And you know I'm fine
        But I hear those voices at night
        Sometimes

        The star maker says, it ain't so bad
        The dream maker's going make you mad
        The spaceman says, everybody look down
        It's all in your mind

        The star maker says, it ain't so bad
        The dream maker's going make you mad
        The spaceman says, everybody look down

        It's all in your mind
        It's all in my mind
        It's all in my mind
